- What version of nuka-carousel are you using? <!-- example: 5.2.0 -->

- What browser are you using? <!-- example: Desktop Safari, Version 15.6 (17613.3.9.1.5) -->

### Describe the Problem

<!--
  It's easier to show us than tell us what's going wrong with your code.
  Because of this, we ask that you choose one of the following methods to help us reproduce the bug:

  A. Create a public minimal repository that we can `git clone`, with install + error reproduction steps in the README.
  B. Create a sandbox (example: codesandbox.io/s/n39x25), reproduce your issue in the code, and paste the link here.
  C. Open up a PR, include "WIP" and the Issue # in the title, and point us to the failing regression tests.
