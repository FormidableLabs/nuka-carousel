# Callbacks

## Before/After Slide

Functions that are invoked when the progression methods (goBack()/goForward()) are called or when carousel changes its scroll position.

### Details

| Prop Name     | Type       | Default Value |
| :------------ | :--------- | :------------ |
| `beforeSlide` | () => void | `undefined`   |
| `afterSlide`  | () => void | `undefined`   |

- `beforeSlide` - Runs a given function before scrolling when a progression method is called. It will also run right before the carousel registers that it has been scrolled on if manually scrolled.
- `afterSlide` - Runs a given function after scrolling when a progression method is called or after manually scrolling.

### Example

This is a code usage example. Docusaurus will not run passed functions because the components are converted to static HTML at build time.

```tsx
<Carousel beforeSlide={() => myCustomBeforeFunction()}>{/* Cards */}</Carousel>
```

```tsx
<Carousel afterSlide={() => myCustomAfterFunction()}>{/* Cards */}</Carousel>
```
