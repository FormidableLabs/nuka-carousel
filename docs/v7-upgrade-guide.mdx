title: 'v7 Upgrade Guide'
---

Nuka Carousel 7 is a major release that introduces changes to make the carousel better align with the WCAG Aria Authoring Practices Guide. This guide will help you upgrade from v6 to v7.

## New props

- `tabbed` determines whether roles should follow the WCAG tabbed carousel requirements.
- `landmark` prop determines whether role should be a region landmark or have role group.
- `carouselId` prop gives the carousel frame an id attribute which can be uniquely targeted by controls.

## Changes in functionality

- The `frameAriaLabel` default value has been changed to 'slider'
- Default pagination dots have been given the role `tab` and aria-controls will target their slide.
- Pagination dots parent has been given the role `tablist`. As tabs need to be the immediate child of `tablist`, and since `tablist` already has list semantics, `ul` and `li` have been removed.
- When the `tabbed` prop is `true`, slides will have the role `tabpanel` indicating they are the target of the tab, otherwise they will have the role `group` and a description of slide.
- When the `tabbed` prop is `false`, default pagination dots will not be rendered.
- Default next and previous buttons now target the slider frame with aria-controls.

## Changes in dev tooling

- This release adds `jest-axe` and their corresponding as dev dependencies to ensure Nukaâ€™s test suite verifies accessibility.
